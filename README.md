## Ariturlte Font

Is it a font? Or a typeface?  Does the design of the s make you angry?  Does the design of the t make you sad?  Fork it, improve it, submit a PR.

## Description
This is a font (typeface?) that I started making to use for various banners and logos across the AristurtleDev GitHub repositories.  The idea initially was to create a rounded font where all characters, where possible, used the same angle for the curves.  There are some letters I struggled in this concept with such as the m and the s as you can probably see (future note: delete this statement when someone PRs a better version).

I'm putting this into a repository because 

1. I'm not a font and/or typeface designer
2. It could use improvements

And it is with these to points that I and maybe other people might want to add to it? Or not.  You do you. Either way, here's the repo, heres the font, read the license, have a good one â™¥
